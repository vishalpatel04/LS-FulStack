    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm a Vishal Chandra Patel from Raigarh,Chhattisgarh pursuing Civil Engineering from IIT Bombay.As I share my journey as a student at IIT Bombay, I must say — it has been an incredible experience filled with joy and learning. From the very first day on campus to the moment I’m writing this reflection, every part of it has been memorable.

        My journey began with meeting my batchmates — learning their names, where they came from, and having lots of friendly conversations. It was a great start, full of excitement and new connections.
        
        Soon after, my academic journey took off. I still remember the first day of class — we had an introductory session where each student had to speak a few words about themselves. It was a warm and engaging experience, and to this day, I consider it one of the best moments I’ve had at IIT Bombay.
